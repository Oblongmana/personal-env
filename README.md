# personal-env

A fairly small project containing things used in my personal environment. Note that this is specific to OSX.

Currently contains only `.bash_profile_pub`: bash_profile elements I commonly use/rely on being set/whatever, that don't contain any sensitive info. Can be imported into your `.bash_profile` with:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile_pub
```

If you're using the repo as the master, you'll probably want to create a [hard] link to the repo

```bash
cd ~
ln path/to/.bash_profile_pub
```
